      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Stephen John Brademas, Jr. (1927-2016) was born in Mishawaka, Indiana to Beatrice Goble
        Brademas, a schoolteacher, and Stephen John Brademas, Sr., a Greek-immigrant restaurateur.
        Brademas graduated from South Bend Central High School and entered the University of Notre
        Dame in 1945, but soon left to join the Navy where he was appointed to the Naval Reserve
        Officers Training Corps until May 1946. In September of that year, he entered Harvard
        College and in 1949 graduated with a B.A. in Government. From 1950 to 1953, he studied as a
        Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, England, where he received a Doctor of Philosophy in
        Social Studies. <lb/>
        <lb/> From 1959 to 1980, Brademas represented the Third District of Indiana in the United
        States House of Representatives. He served on the Education and Labor Committee, the House
        Administration Committee, and the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress. Brademas
        played a principal role in writing major legislation concerning all forms of education,
        including elementary, collegiate, and vocational training. He was also a major proponent of
        legislation for services for the elderly and handicapped, as well as Federal support for
        cultural institutions and the arts. In January 1973, Brademas was appointed Chief Deputy
        Majority Whip and in 1977 was appointed Majority Whip, a position he held for the next four
        years. <lb/>
        <lb/> After leaving public office, Brademas accepted the position of President of New York
        University (NYU), serving from 1981 to 1992. During his tenure, he worked to change NYU from
        a primarily commuter school by facilitating the construction or purchase of 11 residence
        halls, which by the time he left, housed 44 percent of the NYU student population. Under his
        guidance, NYU also added new academic programs including the Onassis Center for Hellenic
        Studies and the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. During his tenure,
        Brademas established NYU programs in Cyprus, Egypt, France, Israel and Japan. In July of
        1990, he announced his resignation and officially stepped down from his position, becoming
        president emeritus in 1992 after a sabbatical. <lb/>
        <lb/> After leaving NYU, Brademas served as chairman of the President's Committee on the
        Arts and the Humanities from 1994 to 2001. From 2004 to 2007, he was a member of the New
        York State Board of Regents. In 2005, NYU established the John Brademas Center of New York
        University, a research and teaching facility. He was the recipient of more than 50 honorary
        degrees and awards, many conferred by European governments or cultural organizations.
        Brademas passed away in 2016.</p>

      <p>Decisions regarding arrangement interventions for this collection prior to 2018 are not yet
        recorded. During this same time, sections of the material were refoldered and an inventory
        was created. <lb/>
        <lb/> In 2019 memorabilia was rehoused by Preservation and sent to offsite storage. During
        the processing of this collection, the remaining material was foldered and previously
        overstuffed folders were separated and refoldered. Original titles were transcribed onto the
        new folders when possible. All material was placed in appropriately sized containers.
        Audiovisual material was removed and boxed separately. Previously untitled and undated files
        were provided more description and dates, while any new file titles were added to the end of
        the inventory within each series. <lb/>
        <lb/> File titles were reviewed by the processing archivist and when identified as
        restricted, were physically separated, notated in the file title (e.g., "Correspondence
        RESTRICTED"), physically separated, and stored in shared restricted boxes. <lb/>
        <lb/> One carton of audiovisual material, four cartons of paper, and 22 boxes of personnel
        files were removed and deaccessioned from the collection. Twenty-five containers of material
        were separated from this collection and transferred to other NYU special collections. <lb/>
        <lb/> Folder titles in the Development Series were not published in the finding aid due to

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The collection contains records of New York University's 13th President John Brademas who
        served from 1981 to 1991. Files created by Brademas' office contain material related to the
        responsibilities of this position, including public appearances and events; contact with
        various NYU Schools and Divisions staff; interaction with student groups and
        representatives; and fostering NYU's relationships with various governmental departments and
        other organizations as they relate to funding and/or educational policy for universities. <lb/>
        <lb/> Files in this collection include Brademas' speeches and remarks; NYU Board meeting
        material; and public relations event planning files which include video recordings related
        to NYU's acquisition of the La Pietra villa. Additionally, this collection contains internal
        and external communications, reports, and meeting notes related to NYU facilities, NYU
        Schools and Divisions, and student groups. Files accumulated by Brademas on individuals,
        organizations, and companies document his relationships cultivated for the purpose of
        fundraising, educational policy support, and NYU program development. Although a selection
        of Brademas' chronological correspondence has its own series, a significant amount of
        topical correspondence can be found throughout the entire collection. <lb/>
        <lb/> Pre-1981 office files in this collection were likely a carry-over from the previous
        President's office and used for reference by Brademas and his staff. Material dated beyond
        Brademas' term found in this collection covers projects he continued for NYU working as
        president emeritus, after officially leaving office in 1991.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series contains Brademas' appointment books from 1981 to 1991, documenting his
            daily events and meetings. Other files include material related to the Bobst Award;
            honorary degrees; selection process for departmental chairs and visiting professors;
            fundraising; and university program development. Information on NYU's overseas programs;
            the Urban Studies and Research Center; the Grey Art Gallery; and the Japanese Business
            Center are in this series. The "JB Project" files appear to be ideas fostered by
            Brademas, including a Chinese University Presidents' group visit to NYU and a potential
            Latin American Foreign Ministers Conference. Brademas' travel briefing books in this
            series were created for his trips taken between 1989 to 1990 to Greece, Cyprus, and
            France. These briefing books typically contain schedules, support material for meetings,
            and profiles on people he would meet during the trip. Similar travel briefing material
            can also be found in Series VII.</p>

          <p>Most of the files in this series are NYU Board of Trustees material dating from 1980 to
            1990, including meeting minutes and agendas, President's Reports, committee information,
            individual member files, and Presidents' Congratulatory files. This series also contains
            files related to Brademas' trips to Japan, Asia, Poland, Spain, South America, and
            Yugoslavia on behalf of NYU, which would often involve Board of Trustees members.

          <p>This series mainly contains public relations office material related to appearances and
            events Brademas attended or organized while serving as President of NYU. Files in this
            series contain requests for Brademas appearances and speeches; planning files for NYU
            events; and correspondence. A small collection of speeches in this series date from 1981
            to 1984; however, a more comprehensive set can be found in Series XIII. Planning files
            for events hosted in Brademas' penthouse residence are in this series and typically
            include invitation lists, menus, and schedules. Clippings and press releases in this
            series feature Brademas and his connection to NYU. Photographic portraits of Brademas,
            as well as event photographs are in this series. Event photographs include parties at
            the Onassis Center in Greece, and Brademas' trips to Asia. A large number of video
            recordings in this series contain footage for a possible informational video for NYU's
            Villa La Pietra in Florence, Italy. These videos contain interviews with Sir Harold
            Acton, views of the building and grounds, and historical stock footage.</p>

          <p>This series contains John Bradmas' speeches, writings, and interviews while serving as
            President of NYU. The speeches (1981 to 1991) are from events including NYU graduations,
            Board of Trustee and Senate University meetings, and other public appearances. Speech
            files often contain final copy and drafts; notes; and informational memos containing
            event location, time/date, and background. Three of these speech files also include
            video recordings. Unless otherwise stated, the speeches were delivered by Brademas.
            Yearly NYU graduation ceremony files often contain detailed schedules, event programs,
            and speeches from all presenters. This series also contains op-ed pieces, articles, and
            memos written by Brademas. Presidential greetings and letters for use by various NYU
            publications are also in this series.</p>
