      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Michael Lally (1942- ) was born and raised in New Jersey. He joined the Air Force in 1962 and after four years left the service. Through the G.I. Bill he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Iowa. In 1969, he moved to Washington, D.C. to teach at Trinity College. While in D.C. he became involved in the local poetry scene, where he established the Mass Transit poetry reading series which was considered an important incubator for Language Poetry, and launched a poetry publishing collective, Some of Us Press (SOUP) with wife Lee Lally, Ed Cox, and Tina Darragh. SOUP published Lally's book,  <emph render="italic">The South Orange Sonnets,</emph> in 1972. In 1975 Lally separated from his first wife, the poet Lee Lally, and moved to New York, where he wrote poetry; founded a small publishing company, O Press; and also edited the anthology <emph render="italic">None of the Above: New Poets of the USA.</emph>
<lb/>
<lb/>
In 1982 Lally moved to Los Angeles to pursue opportunities in film and television as a writer and actor. He appeared in numerous movies, television episodes, and plays including <emph render="italic">Basic Instinct</emph>,  <emph render="italic">White Fang</emph>, <emph render="italic">Father Dowling Mysteries</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Deadwood</emph>. In addition to writing his own original screenplays and plays, Lally was a script doctor in which he contributed to existing screenplays. During his time in Los Angeles, Lally co-founded the Poetry in Motion series (1988–1996), which received media attention for its mix of Hollywood celebrities and poets. While living in California Lally also helped found and edit the original <emph render="italic">Venice</emph> magazine. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Lally has published over 27 books of poetry and memoirs. His awards include the 92nd St. Y Poetry Center's Discovery Award for <emph render="italic">The South Orange Sonnets</emph>; numerous National Endowment for the Arts grants; and the 2000 American Book Award for <emph render="italic">It's Not Nostalgia</emph>. In 2006, Lally started the blog "Lally's Alley" (http://lallysalley.blogspot.com/) in which, as of 2019, he continues to write daily reflections on his personal life, movies, politics, and poetry. As of 2019, he is living and working in New Jersey.</p>

      <p>In 2012, the material was collected by Granary Books during two visits to Michael Lally's home in Maplewood, New Jersey. Much of the material had been preliminarily sorted and organized by Michael Lally. The collection was transported to Granary Books in New York City where portions were refoldered and rearranged.

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>In 2012, the material was collected during two visits from Michael Lally's home in Maplewood, New Jersey. Much of the material had been preliminarily sorted and organized by Michael Lally. The collection was transported to Granary Books in New York City where it was processed and a detailed inventory was created. Appoximately 80% of the physical material was re-foldered at that time, while maintaining most of Lally's original arrangement. The exception was the correspondence, which was interfiled, notating a code letter on each folder to identify Lally's original categories. These code letters identify correspondence received while he was at a particular location or friends he first met there. The following are the codes assigned to Lally's designations and notated on each folder: (D) Washington, D.C. letters and people; (I) Iowa letters and people; (L) L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets; (LA) Los Angeles, Hollywood, and California; and (N) New York City.
<lb/></p>
      <p>In circa 2012-2013, the material was purchased by the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections and transferred to NYU. In 2019 a processing archivist performed a survey, using the seller inventory and determined the physical arrangement of the collect would largely remain as it was received from the seller, but arranged into three series, rather than the Granary Books' original six. 
<lb/></p>
      <p>Material was kept in their existing folders when possible, maintaining their original titles, while any loose material, specifically the publications, were foldered and assigned labels created by the processing archivist. Some overstuffed folders were separated out into multiple folders. Any oversize material was unrolled and placed in appropriately-sized folders in boxes or flat-file drawers.
<lb/></p>
      <p>Born-digital material was inventoried, labeled, and imaged. Discs were processed using Forensic Toolkit, and video and audio were imaged and uploaded to permanent storage. A quarter of the discs were deaccessioned due to duplication, or simply too corrupted to open. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.
<lb/></p>
      <p>Sound and video recordings were grouped and stored by format and described to the box level. Commercially produced audiovisual material was removed from the collection and if it was found to exist in the NYU holdings, it was deaccessioned. Those items not in NYU's holdings were transferred to the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media.
<lb/></p>
      <p>In 2019, an entry for the archived website was added to the finding aid in Series III.A.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Michael Lally Papers contains material on both Lally's professional and personal life. This material includes a significant collection of correspondence specifically related to Lally's involvement with the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets during their formative years, with small publishers, and with people in the poetry communities in Iowa City, Washington, D.C., and New York City during the 1970s through the 2000s.  
Lally's writing files include his manuscripts and drafts for poetry books and articles, as well as working files on his publishing companies, O Press and Some of Us Press (SOUP). A mix of paper and electronic files relate to his poetry readings through posters, publicity, and images from events. Small press publications and alternative journals in this collection contain many of Lally's writings, dating from the late 1960s through the 1990s, reflecting the output of poetry and literary communities during this time. Acting scripts, movie and play posters, publicity, and analog and digital audiovisual material represent Lally's work as an actor and screenwriter in Los Angeles during the 1980s through the 2000s. Personal journals, scrapbooks, calendars, address books, school yearbooks and papers, digital photographs, and correspondence with family and friends date from the 1950s to the 2000s.

            <p>This subseries contains material related to Michael Lally's performances as a poet, including poetry readings and recorded spoken albums.

See Series II.C. for correspondence files on this project. Electronic records in this subseries contain poetry reading albums and other event recordings, including <emph render="italic"> Jazzspeak: A Word Collection </emph>, <emph render="italic">Michael Lally: Lost Angels</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Poets Against War</emph>. Digital images of a 2004 poetry reading and a digital video recording of a documentary on Hubert Selby, Jr. with a Lally interview are also in this subseries.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains correspondence with poets, writers, and colleagues, which often include  manuscripts and ephemera. Lally's correspondence documents his involvement with the avante garde L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet group during their formative years in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the poetry communities in Iowa City, Washington, D.C., and New York City. Correspondence is especially extensive with those he collaborated with and published through O Press and Some of Us Press (SOUP) in the 1970s, including Bruce Andrews, Max Blagg, Joe Brainard, Gerald Burns, Tina Darragh, Ray DiPalma, Tim Dlugos, Etheridge Knight, Jerome Sala, and Terence Winch. This series also contains four poster-sized message paintings by Sylvia Schuster.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains correspondence dating from the 1970s through the 2000s which had been separated from Lally's manuscript files, specifically relating to the publication of his works through smaller presses. Those correspondents with extensive files include Dennis Cooper with Little Ceasar Press, John and Elaine Gill from The Crossing Press, and George Mattingly from Blue Wind Press and Something Else Press. This subseries also contains a large collection of correspondence, mail art, and manuscripts from Jim Haining of Salt Lick Press, of which Lally's book <emph render="italic">Catch My Breath</emph> was one of the company's best selling works.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains correspondence from friends and colleagues Lally accumulated while living in Los Angeles as an actor, playwright, and screenwriter in the 1980s through the 2000s. Of note are letters from actors Sharon Stone, Carrie Fisher, and Michael O'Keefe. Letters and a 1987 collage <emph render="italic">Lally</emph> by artist Paul Harryn can also be found in this subseries. Poetry written by friends for Lally's 50th birthday is in this subseries. This subseries also contains correspondence for Lally's Poetry in Motion project, which was a spoken word series co-created with Eve Brandstein in 1988. Lally's series brought together poets and Hollywood celebrities including Alec Baldwin, Robert Downey, Jr., Ally Sheedy, and Michael O'Keefe for readings. See Series I.C. for publicity files on this project.</p>

            <p>This subseries contains correspondence from 1966 to 1997 with Lally's friends and family. Correspondence from Lally's first wife Lee while he served in the Air Force describe their courtship and wedding plans, as well as cards and notes after their marriage. Letters from friends to Lee Lally from the 1960s and 1970s kept by Michael Lally are in this series. This subseries also contains letters from Lally's other two wives and his three children. Letters from Lally's parents James and Irene date from 1949 to 1973, sharing news of the family and events in their lives. Correspondence from Lally's siblings are also in this subseries, including letters from 1953-2010 from brother Campion Lally who served as a priest at Franciscan Chapel Center in Japan. A significant portion of the letters from friends in this subseries were sent while Lally was serving in the Air Force in the 1960s.</p>
