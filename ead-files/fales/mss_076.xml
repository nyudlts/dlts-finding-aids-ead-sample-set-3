      <abstract id="aspace_5b4a861c98aaff60261569e9b62ac8cb">Robert Hammond (1920-2009) was a dedicated educator and author in French literature and cinema. He taught at the University of Arizona-Tuscon, Harvard University, and at SUNY-Cortland, where he also served as chair of the International Communications and Culture Department. Hammond published numerous analyses and critiques of French filmography, translated various texts, and contributed countless papers and general scholarship on the French cinema. The Hammond Film Script Collection represents his personal collection of shooting scripts of feature films, the vast majority of which are French (along with assorted English, Spanish and Italian language scripts) spanning the years 1935 - 1996. Accretions to the collection include over 60 scripts from the collection of Marc Maurette, a French filmmaker (and friend of Dr. Hammond) who was assistant director on many of the films included in his gift. As of March 2003, the Hammond Film Script Collection consists of 454 scripts.</abstract>

      <p>The Hammond Film Script Collection was donated to the Fales Library between 1983-1996 through generous contributions made by Dr. Robert Hammond. The original portion of the collection (approximately 275 scripts) were donated in April 1983. Hammond continued to donate scripts after his original gift. Most notable was the major addition of over 60 scripts from the collection of Marc Maurette in 1990.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Robert Hammond (b. 1920) was Professor Emeritus of French Literature and Cinema from SUNY-Cortland. He earned a BA from the University of Rochester (1942), and both an MA (1947) and PhD (1952) from Yale University. He was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to France (1949-1950) along with numerous other honors, fellowships and grants. Hammond was an instructor, and then professor of French at the University of Arizona-Tuscon (1953-1967). He later was professor of French at Harvard University (1965-1966), and a visiting professor of French Literature and Cinema at Wells College in Aurora, NY (1967-1968). After 1968 Hammond taught at SUNY-Cortland, where he also served as chair of the International Communications and Culture Department. He died in Paris, France in May 2009.</p>
      <p>Hammond published numerous analyses and critiques of French literature and films, translated texts between French and English, and contributed countless papers and general scholarship on French cinema. Much of Hammond's scholarly work focused on French filmmaker Jean Cocteau, and his bilingual edition of Cocteau's <title type="simple" render="italic">Beauty and the Beast</title> (NYU Press, 1970) is a widely cited work. Hammond was the author of over 40 plays in both English and French and various other works of both poetry and prose.</p>
      <p>Hammond began collecting film scripts in 1953 when he realized that this category of literary production by such writers as Sartre, Cocteau and Prevert risked falling into oblivion. Hammond believed that their work in film deserved the same literary merit as their poems, novels and plays, and that serious and thorough study of a writer requires consultation of almost everything he/she committed to paper. Further, he observed that critics blandly judged the quality of dialogues in a film from what they remembered having heard during the showing of the film, whereas, in the case of a play, the same or similar critics would spend significantly more time and attention studying the written dialogue before drawing a definite conclusion. Hammond concluded that the written script was crying out to be studied as a facet of literature. He decided to find as many scripts as he could, and to accumulate them in the hope that some day a new generation of scholars might find them a valuable resource.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Hammond Film Script Collection comprises 80 boxes or approximately 35 linear feet of film scripts. Currently, the collection consists of 454 scripts of feature films, the vast majority of which are French (along with assorted English, Spanish and Italian language scripts), representing the years 1935 through 1996. </p>
      <p>The majority of the scripts in the collection are otherwise unpublished texts, and appear as original typed manuscripts or reproductions of manuscripts through various methods such as photocopy, mimeo, carbon-copy, etc. Additionally, some scripts (Series G) are in microfilm format. While most scripts are unbound, some are stapled, glued, or bound in similar fashion. The scripts in the collection were "live" shooting scripts, often accompanied by significant handwritten annotations, diagrams and marginal comments by the director, cast or other production members who utilized the particular script in the course of shooting the film. </p>
      <p>The scripts were collected, in Hammond's words, "by tracking down and hounding anyone possible in the production hierarchy." There has been no systematic process to build the collection other than persistent and often serendipitous discovery by Hammond through his growing network of contacts in the French film industry. As a result, the collection lacks a certain unity, and there are some areas in the collection which have more development than others. For example, almost all of Cocteau, Tacchella and Truffaut are in the collection. Robert, Renoir and Resnais are also well represented. There is some lack of completeness of Spaak, Dreville and Delannoy, and films from the 1930s and 1940s are particularly thin. Among the English language scripts, the collection holds a series of drafts for the film Ragtime, based on E. L. Doctorow's book, along with screenplays for a handful Alfred Hitchcock films.</p>
      <p>In addition to the film scripts collected by Hammond, the Collection includes a selection of plays, screenplays and scripts written by Richard Maibaum, a celebrated American playwright and screenwriter. Maibaum is best known for his work as screenwriter for the James Bond film series (1962-1989).</p>

This gift included not only many French films, but English language and Italian ones as well. Some scripts in this series are duplicated elsewhere in the collection.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">SERIES F: Plays, Screenplays and Scripts of Richard Maibaum</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Series F contains 4 boxes of numerous plays, screenplays and scripts written by Richard Maibaum. A one-time student of NYU, Maibaum studied acting at the University of Iowa. By age 30, Maibaum was a firmly established Broadway actor and playwright. He entered films as a screenwriter in 1937, spending the war years with the Army's Combat Film Division. In 1946, he joined Paramount as both screenwriter and producer, turning out such worthwhile projects as The Big Clock (1948) and the 1949 version of The Great Gatsby. Maibaum later formed a partnership with English producers Irving Allen and Albert Broccoli. This alliance eventually led to the James Bond film series, where Maibaum wrote or co-wrote the screenplay for every Bond film from 1962-1989. Included in this series is one play (The Lilac Bush), written by Maibaum's son, Matthew Maibaum.</p>
      <p>NB: There does not appear to be a direct connection between Robert Hammond and Maibaum, either personally or in relation to the acquisition of these scripts. Nevertheless, the manuscripts are cataloged within the Hammond collection.</p>
