      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>The Metropolitan Council on Housing is non-profit tenant organization that focuses on expanding affordable housing in New York City. The organization was formed in 1959 by a group of labor and housing rights activists, including longtime MCH leaders Jane Benedict and Esther Rand. MCH has fought for increased public housing, the maintenance of rent control, and other housing priorities, using a variety of tactics, including rent strikes and lobbying. MCH is a membership organization, and also has chapters based on buildings. MCH publishes The <emph render="italic">Tenant/Inquilino</emph>and hosts a radio program on WBAI, "Listen to Housing Notebook." The organization's website is: http://www.metcouncil.net/ (accessed June 18, 2007).</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Materials were donated by the Metropolitan Council on Housing in 1995, 2002, and 2008. Preliminary inventories were drafted in 2002 and 2008, which served as the basis for an online guide published in 2009. Sometime before 2007, some audio materials were separated from the collection. In 2013, the separated audio materials were returned to the collection, rehoused, and described. Four unrelated cassettes, including dubbed versions of commercial music recordings, were deaccessioned. In 2014, the archived websites were added as Series VI. In 2015, boxes 47 through 61 were removed and incorporated with the Cooper Square Committee Records (TAM 356) collection as its boxes 1 through 15. In 2016, Series V: 2014 Accretion was added to the collection. Additionally, the numbers of boxes in Series IV: 2008 and Series VI: Audio were updated to reflect the removal of materials transferred to the Cooper Square Committee Records.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Metropolitan Council on Housing Records (dates 1949-2014) contain correspondence, board meeting minutes, press releases, reports, printed ephemera, government documents, and audio and video recording related to the organizing efforts of the Metropolitan Council on Housing (MCR). The first two series of the collection consist of subject and administrative files created by the organization. Administrative files include executive board minutes, programs and ephemera from annual conferences, and records related to MCH's involvement in rent law reforms. Subject files contain records related to specific lobbying campaigns of MCH including rent control and stabilization, public housing, and the Mitchell-Lama housing program.</p>
      <p>Subsequent accretions donated between 2002 and 2014 include additional administrative files, ephemera, photographs, newspaper clippings, and periodicals. These files primarily relate to MCH lobbying campaigns and tenants' rights demonstrations. They include correspondence and administrative files related to MCH's work with other housing rights organizations in the city including the Cooper Square Committee, East Side Tenants Council, and the Riverside Edgecombe Neighborhood Association. The collection contains several boxes of audio recordings including, which predominantly consist of recordings for MCH's radio program on WBLS Radio, "Tenants' Fight for Survival." Also included among these materials are copies of MCH's newspaper <emph render="italic">Tenant</emph>, from 1971 to 2014.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes captures of the Metropolitan Council on Housing's website beginning in 2009.</p>

          <p>This series contains records related to housing rights campaigns of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, mostly from the late 1990s and the early 2000s. A large portion of these materials relate to rent laws and include files on individual building campaigns; the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB); copies of federal, state, and municipal regulations; and newspaper clippings related on housing rights activism. Other materials focus specifically topics affecting individual tenants and tenant demographics, which include Housing Vacancy Surveys, and files on Disability Rent Increase Exemptions (DRIE) and Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemptions (SCRIE). A small amount of the records relate to the history of the Metropolitan Council on Housing and include a copy of the FBI's surveillance file on the organization. Other materials include an assortment of pamphlets and reports on housing and housing rights in New York City. These reports date from the 1950s to the early 2000s. Scattered throughout these boxes are several folders of materials related to the memorial of Met Council founder Jane Benedict, who died in 2005. These materials include her programs from her memorials service, biographical sketches of Benedict and correspondence and ephemera related to the memorial.</p>
          <p>The series also contains one box of Metropolitan Council on Housing photographs and publication mocks. The majority of the photographs document events like housing rights campaigns, demonstrations, meetings, and banquets. Others  depict housing issues in the New York City including photographs of buildings, neighborhood, homeless shelters, and apartments. Photographs were most likely collected and created for use in issues of the Metropolitan Council on Housing's newspaper <emph render="italic">Tenant</emph>. Mockups mostly consist of photograph layouts and date from the 1970s to 1988. </p>
          <p>This series also contains issues of the Met Council's newspaper, <emph render="italic">Tenant</emph>, and copies of other periodicals related to housing rights including <emph render="italic">Tenant News</emph> and <emph render="italic">New York Apartment Law Insider</emph>. Copies of <emph render="italic">Tenant</emph> are mostly complete, and date from 1971 to 2014.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
          <p>The Metropolitan Council on Housing, founded in 1959, is a membership organization dedicated to preserving and expanding New York City's supply of affordable housing. Met Council focuses on preserving rental housing and strengthening tenants' rights. They work through grassroots organizing, lobbying, direct action, including rent strikes, and public education. Met Council has a monthly newspaper (TENANT), a weekly call-in radio show ("Housing Notebook"), forums, and a volunteer-staffed tenant hotline, which is featured on the website. The website contains a help and answers for tenants, past and current campaigns related to the tenant blacklist, tenant bill of rights, rent regulation, gentrification, and tenant safety.  Since 2009, the website has gone through 3 iterations, the most recent in 2019. In 2020, TENANT was spun off as its on website.</p>
