      <abstract id="aspace_693a13837b4549daba644bcf70dab0b9">Charles A. Laverty (1930-2015) was a journalist and historian who was active in Irish republican organizations.  His research interests included the participation of the Irish in American wars, particularly the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.  He was a founding member of the Irish Brigade Association, an organization devoted to the history of the United States Army 69th Infantry Regiment, an historically Irish regiment created in 1849.   The Charles Laverty Papers date from 1767 to 2015, with the bulk of the material dating between 1960 and 2010.  The collection documents Laverty's research interests, his working life, his participation in Irish republican organizations, his family history, and his membership in historical organizations.  The bulk of the collection consists of Laverty's research files on Irish soldiers in American wars, members of the United Irishmen and the Fenian Brotherhood who emigrated to the United States, and members of religious orders who served as medical personnel on battlefields.  The collection also contains correspondence, clippings, photographs, paper and born-digital administrative documents, publications of Irish historical and republican organizations with which Laverty was associated, and a video recording of members of the Irish Brigade Association.  Laverty's work as a journalist is documented mainly through his publication <emph render="italic">Automotive Week</emph>, a weekly newsletter on the automobile aftermarket.  The collection also includes the papers of William V. Kennedy, an author and historian with an interest in the American Civil War.</abstract>

      <p>Donated by Charles Laverty, 2015.  In 2011, Laverty was hospitalized and his papers were moved, without his supervision, from his office.  In 2014, the collection was partly housed in a storage facility and in Laverty's room at a senior living facility, both in New Jersey.  Prior to and following Laverty's death in October 2015, the collection was transferred to New York University in January, April, and October of 2015.  It is not known who packed the collection prior to its transfer to NYU.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Charles Laverty Papers date from 1767 to 2015, with the bulk of the material dating between 1960 and 2010.  The collection documents Laverty's research interests, his working life, his participation in Irish republican organizations, his family history, and his membership in historical organizations.  The bulk of the collection consists of Laverty's research files on Irish soldiers in American wars, members of the United Irishmen and the Fenian Brotherhood who emigrated to the United States, and members of religious orders who served as medical personnel on battlefields.  The research files contain photocopies from 19th and 20th century books, periodicals, and maps, as well as photographs, correspondence, pamphlets, and notes collected and created by Laverty.  He used these files to create a website containing biographies of Irish people who settled in the American colonies and the United States between the 17th century through the 19th century.  Laverty's membership in the Irish Brigade Association and the New York Irish History Roundtable is well documented in this collection through correspondence with members, paper and born-digital business records, clippings and photographs documenting activities of both organizations, and publications of both organizations.  Laverty's work as a journalist is documented mainly through his publication <emph render="italic">Automotive Week</emph>, a weekly newsletter on the automobile aftermarket, with a small amount of material documenting his work at McGraw-Hill in the 1950s.  The collection includes correspondence between Laverty and his family, photographs of his parents and siblings, and clippings about his family's horse breeding business and his brother's soccer career.  Laverty's interest and participation in Irish republican organizations is documented through letters to Laverty from Brian O'Higgins, founding member and president of Sinn Féin; correspondence, publications, and administrative documents from Laverty's participation in Clan na Gael, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, and Irish Prisoners Aid Committee.  The collection also includes the papers of William V. Kennedy, an author and historian with an interest in the American Civil War.  These include articles by Kennedy on the military and Catholicism, his work with the Thompson Battalion Memorial Project Committee, his military career, and his lawsuits brought against the Army War College.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Charles A. Laverty (1930-2015) was a journalist and historian who was active in Irish republican organizations.  His research interests included the participation of the Irish in American wars, particularly the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.  He was a founding member of the Irish Brigade Association, an organization devoted to the history of the United States Army 69th Infantry Regiment, an historically Irish regiment created in 1849.  Laverty was born in Moy, County Tyrone, Ireland in 1930 and immigrated to the United States in 1948.  He worked in journalism and in the publishing industry for over 50 years, writing for the New York Journal-American and working as an editor for automotive magazines and for the Department of Defense before acquiring and publishing the newsletter <emph render="italic">Automotive Week</emph> between 1975 and 2000s.  He served in the United States Army between 1951 and 1953 and was a member of the Army Reserves's Special Forces from 1957 to 1970.  Laverty served as the national secretary for Clan na Gael in the 1960s, the chairman of the Irish Brigade Committee in the 1960s and 1970s, and president of the New York Irish History Roundtable in the early 2000s.  He was an active member of a number of other Irish-American history organizations and Irish political organizations.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Series were created according to six broad topics extant in the collection: Laverty's family life, his career, his interests in Irish and Irish American history and Irish republican politics, his activity in organizations related to these topics, and the William V. Kennedy Papers.  The majority of these materials were not housed in folders and were mixed together with unrelated material.  During the initial survey of the collection in 2018, roughly 50% of the collection was non-archival material with little value, including photocopies from secondary sources and printouts of internet searches.  These materials were identified for deaccessioning.  During the survey, material in each box was identified as belonging to a particular series.  The collection was processed by an archivist between October 2019 and February 2020.  During this time, materials selected for deaccessioning were removed from the collection and materials for each series were brought together physically and housed in archival folders and boxes.</p>

          <p>This series documents Laverty's almost 60 years of involvement with the Irish Brigade Association (IBA) and his interest in the 69th Regiment of the United States Army.  Material in this series dates from 1861 through 2014, with the bulk of the material dating from the early 2000s.  The material includes correspondence, newsletters, paper and born-digital business and subject files, print photographs, a video recording, and ephemera.  The correspondence documents Laverty's involvement in the organization from its founding in the 1960s through his work as the organization's president in the early 2000s and includes correspondence between Laverty and members of Congress, librarians and archivists, historians, and other members of the IBA.  The subject files document the organization's work to locate the graves of former members of the regiment, through correspondence with research organizations and cemeteries, and paper and born-digital lists compiled by Laverty of confirmed and unconfirmed grave sites in cemeteries in New York and other states.  The business files consist of correspondence and notes regarding meetings and events planned by the IBA.  The video recording contains footage of members of the IBA marching in the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade and the ephemera consists of ribbons from IBA events.  Other topics covered by this series include articles and books written by and about the IBA and members of the regiment, Civil War reenactment events, members of religious orders who served as medical personnel with the regiment, and Laverty's personal interest in particular members of the Regiment, including Thomas Francis Meagher and James McKay Rorty.  In addition to the IBA's newsletter, <emph render="italic">The Irish Volunteer</emph>, this series also includes newsletters published by the the 69th Volunteer Corps, and the Veterans Corps 69th Regiment.</p>

          <p>This series documents Laverty's over 50 years of historical research, focused on the Irish in the United States and Irish-Americans.  The main topics of this series include the role of the Irish in American wars, from the Revolutionary War through the Spanish-American War, with a focus on the Civil War; members of the United Irishmen and the Fenian Brotherhood who immigrated to the United States in the 19th century; and members of religious orders who served as medical personnel during the Civil War.  Material in this series dates from 1767 to 2014, with the bulk of the material dating from the 1990s and 2000s, and includes notes, printouts from online sources and photocopies of primary and secondary sources with some notes, books and pamphlets, photographs, maps, correspondence, writings by Laverty, and 18th and 19th century documents purchased by Laverty.  The bulk of the material consists of photocopies of biographical data from secondary and primary sources, with notations by Laverty, and lists of and notes on reference sources, including book and article titles, names of historical and research institutions, and names of people to contact regarding Laverty's research interests.  Other material in this series includes lists and notes Laverty compiled from his research files to include in a project first conceived of as a five volume encyclopedia to be titled <emph render="italic">Encyclopedia of Irish-American Military History</emph>, and was later hosted on a website titled IrishAmericanIndex.com.  Other topics of interest to Laverty were cemeteries, in particular grave sites and monuments to Irish and Irish-American soldiers and religious serving as medical personnel; Irish indentured servants in the American colonies; and all Irish settlements in the American colonies and the United States, in particular Cecil County, Maryland.</p>

          <p>This series documents Laverty's participation in numerous organizations related to his interests in history and Irish republican politics.  Material in this series dates from 1926 to 2014, with the bulk of the material dating from 1980s through the 2010s and includes correspondence, ephemera, publications, news releases, and paper and born-digital administrative documents.  Laverty's membership in the New York Irish History Roundtable (NYIHR) and the American Irish Historical Society is documented through correspondence between Laverty and members of both organizations, publications created by both organizations, and agenda and meeting minutes from NYIHR meetings.  Irish republican organizations documented in this series include Sinn Féin, Clan na Gael, the Irish American Unity Conference, and multiple organizations devoted to the cause of Irish political prisoners during the 1970s and 1980s.  Material in this series includes correspondence with members of these organizations, dating from the 1950s through the 2000s; newsletters and ephemera created by these organizations, dating from the 1960s through the 2000s; and internal memoranda dating from the 1950s through the 1960s.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series documents the career and research interests of William V. Kennedy, with material dating from the 1950s through the 2000s.  Material includes scrapbooks, correspondence, and legal documents.  The scrapbooks contain clippings of Kennedy's articles on the military, military history, and the role of religion, particularly Catholicism, in the military.  Kennedy's correspondence documents his work as an instructor at the United States Army War College, his participation in the Thompson Battalion Memorial Project Committee, and the lawsuits he brought against the Army War College in the 1980s.  The latter are supported by legal documents created through these suits.</p>
