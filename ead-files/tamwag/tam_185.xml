The collection focuses on her work as a labor educator in Latin America and the United States after her retirement from the New York school system, and her research in the socialist and labor movements in Latin America. The collection contains her manuscripts, research notes, pamphlets, clippings, newsletters, correspondence, photographs, and other ephemera related to labor unions, including issues facing teachers' unions in New York in the 1970s and 1980s. The collection also contains materials related to the International Socialist Party in the 1970s and 1980s.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Sarah Fanny Simon (1903-1989) was a labor organizer, economist, and socialist. She emigrated to New York from Poland in 1913. After receiving a graduate degree in economics from Columbia University, she became a founder in 1936 of the New York Teachers Guild and taught at James Monroe High School in Brooklyn, N.Y. Simon retired from teaching in 1963 but remained an activist in the Guild's successor organization, the United Federation ofTeachers, serving on its Women's Rights Committee. She was also a founder of the Coalition of Labor Union Women. After her retirement, she traveled throughout Latin America, training labor leaders and wrote an unpublished book-length manuscript "The Labor Movement in Latin America." In 1962 she was hired as the Program Coordinator of the Inter-American Institute for Labor Studies of ORIT (Organizacion Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores) until 1965 and remained in Mexico until she finished writing a training manual for ORIT. She returned to New York but continued to travel back and forth to Latin America, for example in 1973 she took a tour of Latin America on behalf of the United States Information Agency. She was a member of the executive board of the Workers Defense League, served as the Socialist Party U.S.'s representative in international organizations and forums, including as the representative at the United Nations for the International Council of Social Democratic Women and was an associate of Socialist Party leader Norman Thomas.</p>

      <p>Photographs were separated from this collection during initial accessioning and were established as a separate collection, the Fanny Simon Photographs (PHOTOS 114). In 2014, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the Fanny Simon Papers and rehoused in acid-free boxes. </p>
      <p>In 2015, loose materials in the collection were foldered and described by an archivist. No arrangement was apparent. Labelling and groupings of materials apparently made by the donor were retained, but the majority of folder titles are supplied by an archivist.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Fanny Simon Papers contain materials related to activities Simon pursued throughout her life, mostly after her retirement from teaching in the 1962 to her death in 1989. The collection focuses on her work as a labor educator in Latin America and the United States, and her research in the socialist and labor movements in Latin America. The collection contains her manuscripts, research notes, pamphlets, clippings, newsletters, correspondence and other ephemera related to labor unions found in Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, and other Latin American countries. Simon's interests also led to her employment with ORIT, the Latin American branch of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Confederación Internacional de Organizaciones Sindicales Libres [CIOSL]), where she worked to train and lead educational programming for labor educators. Her training materials are also found in the collection. Simon also travelled extensively through Latin America and met with labor and socialist leaders, her detailed journals and photographs document these experiences. </p>
      <p>Simon was also an active member of the Socialist Party; she attended international conferences and served on committees. The majority of the materials are related to the conferences she attended in the late 1970s and 1980s, as well as her interest in the promotion of women within the party. These materials include meeting minutes, speeches, planning materials, and other conference proceedings. </p>
      <p>In addition, the collection is rich in United Federation of Teachers materials, especially on topics Simon was interested in. As a Spanish teacher, Simon was concerned with public school budget cuts, civil rights, bilingual programs, the Retired Teachers Chapter, and the teachers in the Panama Canal Zone. The collection contains correspondence, memoranda, notes, and other materials related to the UFT's advocacy regarding these issues in the 1970s. The collection is rich in her interests in the labor movement, both in the United States and in Latin America, and focuses on the efforts made to educate activists in labor organizing.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
          <p>This series mostly contains correspondence, the majority of which comes from Simon's time as the Program Coordinator of the Inter-American Institute for Labor Studies of ORIT. Some notable correspondents include Julia Vigre, her nephews Gene and Michael H. Granof, American Federation of Teachers President Charles Cogen, Norman Thomas, the Latin American representative to the AFL Serafino Romualdi, Joseph Glazer, and other friends. </p>
          <p>Simon also kept detailed journals from her trips to Latin America, Europe, and Israel, documenting who she met and what she did on a day-to-day basis. On her trips, Simon often met with significant international figures in the labor movement, feminist movement, and Socialist Party, including Paulina Luisi, Emilio Frugoni, Oscar Schnake, Jorge González von Marées, Francisco Villagrán, and Ramón Villeda Morales and representatives from SCIDE (Servicio Cooperativo Interamericano de Educación), SITRATERCO (Sindicato de Trabajadores de La Tela Railroad Company), Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas, Confederacion Revolucionaria de Obreros y Campesinos, SINAMOS (Sistema Nacional de Apoyo a la Movilización Social), SUTE (Sindicato Unico sw Trabajadores) and other unions. Her journals also reveal her disdain of Communists, especially in regard to Communist involvement in the labor movement. </p>
          <p>Photographs mostly depict images from Fanny Simon's trips, the bulk of which are from her 1940 trip to South America. Simon also travelled to Europe in 1927; the photographs mostly feature Switzerland and Italy. There are also photographs taken in Mexico and Guatemala. There are some photographs of the United States, including images of Bar Harbor, Jones Beach, Rainbow Landing, the World's Fair in New York, the Smoky Mountains, Yosemite National Park, and Yellowstone National Park. Other nonprint materials also include postcards from her trips, some correspondence from the trips, and an oversized hand-drawn portrait of Simon.</p>
          <p>Other materials in this series include articles written by Simon, clippings, day planners, membership cards, and other materials acquired on her travels.</p>

          <p>Series II is made up of pamphlets, fliers, clippings, articles, periodicals, newsletters related to land reform and the socialist and labor movement in Latin America, the majority of which date from the 1940s-1970s.</p>
          <p>This series also contains drafts and research for her manuscript, "Luis Emilio Recabarren and the Labor Movement of Chile" written in 1948-1949 under a grant from the Social Science research Council. Simon took most of her notes on index cards, which were most likely used to write her manuscript. Simon also appears to have written a manuscript on the Mexico labor movement.</p>
          <p>Simon also worked for ICFTU-ORIT as the Program Coordinator of the Inter-American Institute for Labor Studies. Materials related to her work with ORIT include program planning, conference proceedings, press releases, lesson plans, meeting minutes, recruitment and proceedings for the "First ICFTU World Conference on Education in the Labour Movement", their publications, <emph render="italic">Interamericana</emph> and <emph render="italic">Noticiario Obrero Interamericana</emph>, and training manuals, including her manual, "How to Teach: A Manual for the Labor Educator."  </p>

          <p>This series mostly contains conference proceedings from International Council of Social Democratic Women, Social Democrats USA, and the Socialist International Congress in the 1970s and 1980s. It includes meeting minutes, speeches, correspondence, handwritten notes, circulars, reports, and memoranda from the Socialist International National Action Committee. The majority of materials Simon saved from conferences often relate to events and activities happening within the Socialist Party in Latin America. Simon was active in promoting female leadership in Socialist Party, and worked to promote that through conferences and the International Women's Year and her involvement in Social Democratic Women and Socialist International Women.</p>

          <p>This series is comprised of research and educational materials for Simon's labor educator classes and her work with the Workers Defense League and Coalition of Labor Union Women. Materials in this series include clippings, circulars, and other materials.</p>
          <p>The majority of the series also includes materials related to the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), including correspondence and memoranda related to the union's protest against the New York City Board of Education's bilingual testing program in 1975, correspondence from teachers outlining curriculum of the bilingual programs in their schools to the union, and the response of the union to ASPIRA v. the New York Board of Education. Other materials related to UFT include lobbying for a higher budget for schools, reports of discrimination by minority teachers to the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the treatment of union members in the Panama Canal Zone after 1979. </p>
