      <abstract id="aspace_cd4c4c07821324bdbcd7f2753820690a">In monitoring their chief rival, the National Maritime Union (NMU), the Seafarers International Union (SIU) collected newspaper clippings on the NMU, as well as material written by and about its president, Joseph Curran. Material on the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor (WCNYH), established in 1953 to investigate, deter, and remedy criminal activity and oversee fair hiring practice in New York Harbor, was also included. These reference files contain photocopies of clippings from the NMU Pilot, a quarterly publication, and from national papers such as the New York Times, San Francisco Call Bulletin, and New York World Telegram, many of them following Curran's career and documenting charges of fraud and racketeering on the New York City waterfront. The collection also includes files on the SIU, containing clippings and other historical material on the union and its presidents, Paul Hall and Frank Drozak.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>The Historical Research Department of the Seafarers International Union (SIU) kept extensive files on Joseph Curran, president of the NMU from 1937 until his death in 1981. "Big Joe" Curran, then an inactive member of the conservative International Seaman's Union, founded the Seaman's Defense Committee during a wildcat strike in 1936 on the Panama Pacific Line's S.S. California. The Committee was renamed the National Maritime Union in 1937, and Curran became its first president. He served as a vice-president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and ran for Congress on the American Labor Party ticket in 1940. After the second World War Curran took a major role in ridding the NMU of Communist-influenced officials and vigorously used the collective bargaining process to advance his union's agenda. In addition to national press coverage of the NMU, the SIU kept clippings of Curran's quarterly column in the NMU Pilot.</p>
      <p>In addition to the NMU and Curran material, the SIU collected historical information, publications and clippings relating to its own activities and its president from 1957, Paul Hall. Hall, a staunch anti-Communist, defended his union against racketeers in the 1940s and 1950s and the encroachment of Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters in the 1960s. He was instrumental in the passing of the Energy Transportation Security Act of 1977. Also included are records of Hall's successor, Frank Drozak, SIU president from 1980 until his death in 1988.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Seafarers International Union of North America (SIU) reference files on the National Maritime Union (NMU) consist almost entirely of newspaper clippings from the NMU Pilot, a quarterly publication, and from national papers such as the New York Times, Boston Globe, and San Francisco Call Bulletin -- many of them following Joseph Curran's career and documenting charges of fraud and racketeering on the New York City waterfront. Of particular interest are the files of Curran's column in the NMU Pilot between 1937 and 1969. The Curran columns are organized by date, but subject headings (provided by the SIU staff) are included at the top of each photocopy. Also of note are folders containing background information on the SIU and its leadership, the SIU pamphlet, "How to get a Job on an Unorganized Ship" and a photocopy of "Seafarers Organizers Handbook" (SIU). Clippings from 1956 and 1963 document the work of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor (WCNYH).</p>
      <p>The collection also contains the archived website for the Seafarers International Union, dating from 2007.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The Seafarers International Union (SIU), Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and Inland Waters District/NMU, AFL-CIO, represents unlicensed United States merchant mariners sailing aboard U.S.-flag vessels in the deep sea, Great Lakes and inland trades. The union also represents licensed U.S. mariners in the Great Lakes and inland sectors. The website for SIU contains news from the union, labor and maritime news, training programs, courses, meeting listings, and issues of their newsletter, the Seafarer's Log. The series also contains the digital archive of the Seafarers International Union (SIU) which provides online access to back issues of the SIU newsletter (also titled 'Seafarers' Log') photographed from microfilm copies going back to 1939, as well as the Herb Brand Historic Files, which consist of photograph collections documenting the 1946 General Maritime Strike and the 1948 United Financial Employees Wall Street Strike.  Archival objects in the SIU digital archive are viewable as PDF documents with descriptive metadata and social bookmarking.  The collections can be browsed by collection and series or using an advanced search function.</p>
