    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>New York University was founded as the University of the City of New-York in 1831. It retained this name until 1896. The University's founders envisioned the school as a departure from other American institutions of higher learning. It would be a nonsectarian university and educate the working classes with a practical and useful curriculum in modern language, sciences and politics. In 1830 a group of men, comprised of local merchants and businessmen, issued "Considerations upon the Expediency and the Means of Establishing a University in the City of New-York," addressed to the citizens of the city. They desired to expand educational opportunities beyond the "privileged class" by establishing a university to prepare young men for a variety of occupations, from merchant to physician.</p><p>The New York State Legislature officially incorporated the University of the City of New-York in 1831. In 1833 the University celebrated its first commencement and graduated three students. The University's first permanent home was completed in 1835. The ornate, marble, neo-Gothic building housed classrooms, apartments and office space as well as a chapel. Before its construction, classes were held further downtown near City Hall. </p><p>For additional information, see:</p><p>"Considerations Upon the Expediency and the Means of Establishing a University of the City of New-York," 1830; The Records of the Founding of the University; RG 1.00; Box 2, Folder 1; New York University Archives.</p><p>Dim, Joan Marans and Nancy Cricco, <emph render="italic">The Miracle on Washington Square: New York University</emph>, Lanham, Maryland: Lexington Books, 2001.</p><p>Jones, Theodore Francis, ed. <emph render="italic">New York University: 1832-1932</emph>, New York: The New York University Press, 1933.</p>  </bioghist>
